                <span class="first">T</span>he non-transparent nature of the student loan system that exists presently is also among the worst I have ever seen. No one seems to know what to do, and what options to choose for their various federal and private loans. Clients tell us they wish they had known of the options we presented to them years earlier. Many people rely on their loan servicers to make the decisions for them – not realizing that the servicers are in reality debt collectors and their primary duty is to represent the creditor – not the borrower. Borrowers are often placed in forbearance where the interest capitalizes every year and the balance rises to often 2-3 times what was originally owed. They are placed into generic income based repayment programs without regard to better options that may be out there. With six different income based programs, they are not “one size fits all” and picking the right one can save tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan, as well as shave years off of the repayment period before debt forgiveness kicks in.

              <p>
                <span class="first">T</span>here are also non-reputable student loan companies out there that are taking advantage of this crisis and lack of transparency. Many don’t do what they say, but yet they take your money. Some people think they are dealing directly with their loan servicer, when in reality they are dealing with a separate company whose name sounds like their servicer.

              <p>
                <span class ="first">T</span>he key in dealing with your student loans nowadays is to take the time to learn all about the system, the players, the loan types and their differences, the options available etc. Or if you don’t have the time, desire or ability to do all of that, then hire someone who is on your side. There is a new area of law called “student loan law” and there are a bunch of us nationwide who call ourselves “student loan lawyers”. We’ve taken the time and spent the money to learn all of this. We’ve represented hundreds of student loan clients over the past few years with outcomes we are very proud of and our clients are very thankful for.</span>

                <span class="first">O</span>ur goal in every case is to try and get our client an affordable and sustainable payment with an end in sight. We put a plan in place to get these loans behind you so you can move on with your life.</b>
